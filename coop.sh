# This scripts allows to run the same executable twice, and blacklist the joystick assigned to the other window.
# This supposes the executable can be run in windowed mode. If not, you may want to wrap it in a "weston" window.
#
# Since we expect to have a windowed mode, we can't really expect the windows to be borderless, but it's not impossible.
# For Gnome you can install the "Hide top bar" extension. If you have access to the code of an SDL application,
# you could hide the border with SDL_SetWindowBordered(window, 0);
# 
# Use win+left and win+right to move the windows to use the left and right half, they may both start at the same position
# You can use Alt+F7 to move your windows to the desired positions and Alt+F8 to resize them.
#
# Let's start by listing the joysticks, we expect to have exactly 2.
# It doesn't matter which one we attach to which window, since the executable is strictly
# the same for both, it will have the same configuration on startup.
